      <h1 id="Section-1-1">GDPR and Fines</h1>
            
        <p> GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a set of regulations and articles put into place by the European Union in 2016. It was fully implemented in 2018 for all EU members. 
        The purpose of this was to replace the outdated act from 1995 (The Data Protection Directive) and to modernise how data is handled, whilst allowing a framework across the EU to ensure compliance is met. 
        GDPR consists of several articles consisting of several subsections and requirements, each of which having to be met. </p>

        <p> If they are not met, then the offending party is met with a fine. Whether this be a set amount or a percentage depends on the company's size, ensuring that businesses get punished the same. 
        Other issues caused by this fine are loss of reputation and loss of trust by consumers, among other things. Below this, there are a handful of articles. These Articles (and Sub-sections) are put
        in place to serve as an extensive guideline for companies to follow. They are available for the public to view, but an example is the following:   </p>

          <div id="Section-1-2">

            <ul class="treeview-ul">

              <li class="li-right"> Personal data shall be:<sup>1</sup> </li> 
              <li> processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’); </li>
              <li> collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes 
              in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);</li>
              <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);</li>
              <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified 
              without delay (‘accuracy’);</li>
              <li>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal 
              data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical
               and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);</li>
              <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or
              organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).</li>
              <li>The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).</li>

        <p> For this section, I will be exploring the fines by the EU for GDPR breaches. Under this text are two graphs. The first is countries by fines, and the second is cumulative fines. They will be separated by section to allow an easier jumping
           point between them, with the graphs cycling.  </p>

    <h2 id="Section-2-2"> Fines by country </h2>
                
      <p> As shown in the graph, Ireland has a considerable amount of fines. Despite this, they have relatively few article breaches. This can be explained in a simple way, but will be expanded upon at a later point. The explanation for it is article  60-62 of GDPR<sup>2</sup>.
        This is in part due to most us Tech companies basing their EU headquarters in Ireland. It is due to this fact that Ireland has such ridiculous fines.  </p>

      <p> Other countries, like Spain or Italy issue many more fines, but they still do not measure up to the amount of money fined by Ireland. The Spanish AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency) is known for pursuing individual complaints, and penalising procedural violations,
        such as cookies, marketing consent and the likes<sup>3</sup>. With these being minor infractions, they typically rack up a lower average fine value, but because they happen so often, it leads to the fine count skyrocketing.  </p>
                
      <p> Spain also primarily focuses on domestic cases rather than cross-border cases. Primarily, their targets are local companies, national public bodies and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). SME cases typically are given smaller fines, even when they are more frequent. 
        As opposed to countries like Luxembourg and Ireland as mentioned previously, who focus on cross-border cases, they tend to yield fewer cases, but significantly larger fines against companies like Meta and TikTok. </p>

      <p> These frequent breaches can be attributed to the consister userbase these two companies (TikTok and Meta) have. With the amount of people using them each day, paired with the amount of data they receive,</p>

        <h2 id="Section-3-1">Ireland — GDPR Article Breaches</h2>

      <script id="Section-3-2">

        drawIrelandPieChart("Ireland_gdpr.csv", "my_dataviz");

      </script>

     <p> The graph shown above displays the article breaches that ireland faces. The most common of which being article 32 and Article 5 of the GDPR conduct. With comapnies such as Meta or TikTok basing their headquarters out of ireland to comply with having a headquarters in the EU,
      it is not a surprise to see why these are the most common breaches. </p>

     <p> Article 32 focuses on the security of personal data, requiring these organisations to implement appropriate technical and organised measures to protect said information. Article 5, however, outlines the fundamentals of data processing (As referenced previously).</p>

      <p> With these being the most common breaches, underlining the basics of data protection, it is no surprise that Ireland is the lead enforcer in terms of both fine value and cross border breaches, even despite having less fines than a country like spain. Paired with their 
      "One-Stop-Shop"<sup>4</sup> method, making Ireland the go-to connection between countries outside of the EU and within the EU. </p>

        <h2 id="Section-4-1">Ireland vs Spain Case Count</h2>

        <div id="countryChart"></div>

      </div>

      <h2 id="Section4-2"> Disparity in Fines.</h2>

      <p> The reason for this is simple. As mentioned previously, Spains "one-stop-shop" means it handles a variety of cross border cases, which often result in much large fines. Doing this however, takes time as they have to run longer investigations, focus on major violations as 
        opposed to several smaller ones, and are generally more complex due to being multinational.</p>

      <p> Spain, on the other hand, issues more frequent fines. Specifically to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). These fines, whilst very often smaller in scope than cross-border cases, are enforced strongly. Primarily, they focus on penalizing marketing/consent violations consistently[3].</p>

      <p> With this, it leads to the disaprity seen in the chart above, in which spain has over a thousand more fines, but looking at the chart in section 2, they still fall far behind Ireland in the total revenue from fines. Based on spain also focusing on SMEs, with fine size depends on
         company revenue, the fine ceilings are considerably lower for smaller companies, especially so for improper marketing messages and improper data handling. Ireland however, which focus on platform-wide consent failures and cross-border data transfers, often have a larger fine ceiling
          due to the amount of users affected by it. </p>
