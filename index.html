              <h1 id="Section-1-1">GDPR and Fines</h1>
            
              <p> GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a set of regulations and articles put into place by the European Union in 2016. It was fully implemented in 2018 for all EU members. 
              The purpose of this was to replace the outdated act from 1995 (The Data Protection Directive) and to modernise how data is handled, whilst allowing a framework across the EU to ensure compliance is met. 
              GDPR consists of several articles consisting of several subsections and requirements, each of which having to be met. </p>

              <p> If they are not met, then the offending party is met with a fine. Whether this be a set amount or a percentage depends on the company's size, ensuring that businesses get punished the same. 
              Other issues caused by this fine are loss of reputation and loss of trust by consumers, among other things. Below this, there are a handful of articles. These Articles (and Sub-sections) are put
              in place to serve as an extensive guideline for companies to follow. They are available for the public to view, but an example is the following:   </p>
