DENMARK,,2019,"Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR, The Danish DPA reported the taxi company to the police and recommended a fine (of 1.2M DKK) for non-adherence to the data-minimization principle. While the company deleted the names of its passengers from all its records after two years, the deletion did not include the rest of the ride records (about 8,873,333 taxi trips). Hence, the company continued to hold onto individual's phone numbers. 

Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts."
DENMARK,2021-02-12,"13,450","Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR, Art. 5 (2) GDPR, Original summary: On June 3, 2019, the Danish DPA (Datatilsynet) reported IDdesign to the police and demanded payment of a fine in the amount of EUR 200,850 for the processing of personal data of approximately 385,000 customers for a longer period than necessary for the purposes for which they were processed.  Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. 



Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. 



Update: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine. Such as that the company had not previously breached the GDPR, as well as that the breach concerned only general personal data. In addition, no data subject suffered damages as a result of the breach. Finally, the court considers that the negligent nature of the breach should be taken into account."

The complaints concerned the creation of a Google account during the configuration of a mobile phone using the Android operating system.

As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year.



The breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack. The system was vulnerable to attack because of a redirection problem with the organisation's webpage.

It is worth it to mention that the proceeding initiated before May 2018, but the Italian data protection authority issued a fine under the GDPR since the Rousseau platform had not adopted security measures required by means of an order issued after the 25th of May 2018. Interestingly, the fine was not issued against the Movimento 5 Stelle that is the data controller of the platform, but against the Rousseau association that is the data processor."

The authority verified incompliance with the information obligation in relation to natural persons conducting business activity – entrepreneurs who are currently conducting such activity or have suspended it, as well as entrepreneurs who conducted such activity in the past. The controller fulfilled the information obligation by providing the information required under Art. 14 (1) – (3) of the GDPR only in relation to the persons whose e-mail addresses it had at its disposal. In case of the remaining persons the controller failed to comply with the information obligation – as it explained in the course of the proceedings – due to high operational costs. Therefore, it presented the information clause only on its website. According to the UODO this is not sufficient.

Addendum: In the meantime, the court has cancelled the fine due to procedural errors. The amount of the fine has to be determined by the concrete number of data records concerned. However, the Office had not submitted any verifiable evidence in this regard, but had simply assumed that 6 million data sets were involved, which the data controller had denied. Therefore, important statements were missing. In particular, it was incorrect to justify the amount of the fine on the basis of general preventive considerations. Art. 58 GDPR expressly states that a fine imposed must be related to the specific facts of the case. The Polish data protection authority has already announced that the fine will be revised in a new administrative procedure."

Using the personal data obtained in this way, he then carried out a so-called SARS enquiry with the Federal Network Agency, in which he asked not only for the personal data of the injured parties but also for the home and mobile phone numbers stored there. Using the mobile phone number obtained in this way, the police officer contacted the injured party by telephone - without any official reason or consent given by the injured party.

Through the ZEVIS and SARS enquiry for private purposes and the use of the mobile phone number obtained in this way for private contact, the police officer has processed personal data outside the scope of the law on his own authority. This infringement is not attributable to the police officer's department, since he did not commit the act in the exercise of his official duties, but exclusively for private purposes. The prohibition of punishment under § 28 LDSG, according to which the sanctions of the GDPR cannot be imposed on public bodies, does not apply in the present case, since it was neither a case of misconduct attributable to the authority nor is the person concerned to be classified as a separate public body within the meaning of § 2 (1) or (2) LDSG in the case of the acts in question."

The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry."

In addition, the company gave employees the false impression that it was processing their personal data under the legal basis of consent, while in reality it was processing their data under a different legal basis.  This was in violation of the principle of transparency and thus in breach of the obligation to provide information under Articles 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) of the GDPR.

The fine was imposed against the school which had used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of students. Even though, in general, data processing for the purpose of monitoring attendance is possible doing so with facial recognition is disproportioned to the goal to monitor attendance.  The supervisory authority is of the opinion that biometric data of students was processed which is why Art. 9 GDPR is applicable. Additionally, the authority argued that consent can not be applied since students and their guardians cannot freely decide if they/their children want to be monitored for attendance purposes. When examining if the school board can rely on any of the exemptions listed in Art. 9 (2), the supervisory authority found that this was not the case. The supervisory authority also found that there was a case of a processing activity with high risks since new technology was used to process sensitive personal data concerning children who are in a dependency position to the high school board and due to camera surveillance being used in the students everyday environment. In the view of the authority, the school board was not able to demonstrate compliance with Art. 35 GDPR and that the school board was required to consult the authority in accordance with Art. 36 (1) GDPR."

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage."

This also applies to persons who hold political office, even though these offices are generally less worthy of protection due to their public status and articles relating to political persons may therefore be stored for a longer period of time. Google's rejection of the application was therefore in breach of Article 17 of the GDPR (fine for this breach: €500,000).

The data breach concerned the privacy settings of user posts on the social media platform Twitter. There, users have the option to set the visibility of their posts to private or public.

The DPA found that Twitter had not properly fulfilled its reporting and documentation obligations. Twitter's legal team became aware of the error on January 2nd, 2019, and it was not until January 8th that the company informed the DPC. Consequently, the company failed to inform the DPC within the 72-hour period required by Art. 33 (1) GDPR.

Customers of the bank were supposed to accept new privacy policies allowing the controller to transfer the customers' personal data to all companies within the CaixaBank Group. At the same time, the data subjects were not given the option of specifically not consenting to this transfer. Instead, if they wished to disagree with the transfer of their data, they were required to send a letter of disagreement to each individual company in the group.

The DPA concluded that the bank had violated its information obligations as set out in Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR, as the information provided to customers under the privacy policy was not consistent, contained imprecise terminology, and did not provide sufficient information on the type of personal data processed and the nature of the processing.  Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. 

Furthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data. The DPA further concludes that, as a result, the data was unlawfully transferred to the companies of the CaixaBank Group. This constitutes a violation of Art. 6 GDPR.

The recording was ultimately made available on social media and in the media. The DPA found that the security company as a data processor enabled the breach by not maintaining adequate and sufficient technical and organizational measures for personal data security for more than two and a half years. Moreover, the processor has not foreseen or implemented adequate technical security measures following the incident to prevent or minimize the risks. One data subject was consequently exposed to insults and ridicule in the public and the security company has not taken any action to remove the recording from social networks and media. The amount of the fine is unknown at the moment, but the DPA clarified which aggravating circumstances it has taken into consideration when determining the fine – (i) the fact that the processor did not fulfil its obligation to inform the controller of the incident as required by the Art 33 (2) GDPR and (ii) the fact that the basic activity of the company is the provision of physical and technical protection, which includes the use of video surveillance. The DPA also noted that the fined security company is one of the leading companies in Croatia in that activity and as such should be the relevant entity in providing opinions, guidelines, advice and propose solutions to controllers on the use of the video surveillance system and give an example to its work and pay greater attention to it than others."

The Italian National Institute for Social Security had been tasked with anti-fraud investigations related to COVID-19 relief funds. After press reports raised problems with the institute's data processing practices around the application review of politicians, the Italian DPA opened an investigation against INPS in August 2020. During that investigation, the DPA identified several violations. 

The controller had collected data on tens of thousands of politicians from public sources and cross-checked it with data from applicants. In doing so, however, the controller had failed to ensure that data was collected only from those politicians who were eligible to receive the assistance funds. In doing so, the controller violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency as set out in the GDPR.

Furthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.

Furthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Update: Following an appeal presented by INPS the judge of the XVIII civil section of the Court of Rome annulled the fine of EUR 300,000."

The data subject had outstanding payments of rent with her landlord, who had previously sent her corresponding requests for payment. The controller itself had also sent notices to the data subject requesting her to pay the debts. These, however, did not contain any information that the data subject would be entered in the debtors' register in the event of non-payment. 
Also, the rental contract of the data subject did not contain any provisions in this regard, which led the DPA to conclude that the controller did not have a legitimate interest within the terms of the GDPR and thus had processed the personal data of the data subject without a legal basis."

The data subjects complained about advertising calls and messages (e-mail and SMS) made on behalf of Vodafone España as part of marketing campaigns. The contact was made without the prior consent of the data subjects and continued even after they had exercised their right to object. Furthermore, many data subjects were contacted even though their numbers were on the Robinson list.



The AEPD explains that aggravatingly, it took into account that Vodafone España had regularly received fines in more than 50 cases from January 2018 to February 2020, and the fact that there had been 162 complaints received by the AEPD in just under two years. 



The fine is composed as follows: EUR 4 million for a breach of Art. 28 GDPR and Art. 24 GDPR; EUR 2 million for a breach of Art. 44 GDPR; EUR 150,000 for a breach of Art. 21 LSSI; and EUR 2 million for a breach of Art. 48 (1) b) LGT, Art. 21 GDPR and Art. 23 LOPDGDD."

These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. 



The area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.



It was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.



The Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.



The decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons. These are activities where the data subjects do not expect to be monitored, and even less they expect the monitoring to be broadcast live on the Internet."

In 2017, the municipality decided to install special measurement boxes to measure crowds in the city center of Enschede. Sensors in the measurement boxes detected the wifi signals from the cell phones of passers-by and registered them with a code. Based on the registered codes, it was possible to calculate how busy the city center was. However, this also made it possible to track which measurement box a particular cell phone passed by, making it possible to track the movement of passers-by. The municipality states that it was never its intention to track passers-by. However, the DPA finds that the wifi tracking (even if it was unintentional) constitutes a serious breach of the GDPR. The DPA concludes that the municipality tracked its passers-by without an effective legal basis and thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR."

In all 21 regions of Sweden, a telephone hotline that offers advice on various health-related topics can be reached by dialing 1177. Each region operates its own health advice service, either internally or through contracted subcontractors, but together they form a national network.
In 2019, the media reported that recorded calls to the 1177 helpline were available on a web server without password protection or other security measures. 
All calls to the 1177 number initially went to the company Inera, which managed and developed the shared systems. Calls to the number 1177 from people living in the Stockholm, Sörmland and Värmland regions were put through by Inera to Medhelp AB, which took the calls. Medhelp had in turn contracted the Thai company Medicall Co Ltd. to take calls on weekends and at night. Both Medhelp and Medicall had a contract with the technology company Voice Integrate Nordic AB for, among other things, call recordings. A data breach had then occurred in which recordings of calls to the number 1177 were available on the Internet on a storage server belonging to Voice Integrate. 
The incident resulted from the misconfiguration of a network-attached storage device that was publicly accessible over the Internet and did not use encrypted communications. A large number of calls were accessed due to the vulnerability. 

The Swedish DPA found that MedHelp had failed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security to protect personal data so that unauthorized persons could not access it. Similarly, MedHelp had failed to properly inform callers about the processing of their personal data in accordance with Art. 13 GDPR. 

In addition, the DPA finds the outsourcing of the processing of personal data to Medicall to be a breach of the legality principle set out in the GDPR. This is because Medicall is not covered by Swedish health and medical legislation and is therefore not subject to the legally regulated confidentiality obligation that exists in the Swedish healthcare sector."

The video surveillance was taking place around the clock, although the controller itself stated that video surveillance was only required in case of emergency alarms.

The DPA concludes that the 24/7 monitoring was too far-reaching, but notes that the controller had weighty reasons for the camera surveillance. However, the camera surveillance should be limited to emergencie cases. The fine is composed proportionally of EUR 29,800 for a violation of Art. 5 (1) a), c) GDPR and EUR 5,000 for a violation of Art. 32 (1), (4) GDPR."

The section had been activated shortly before for 500 selected customers and was intended, among other things, to provide an overview of loans taken out with the controller. 
Based on investigations into the case, the DPA found that the controller had not complied with the GDPR's requirements for risk assessment and appropriate technical measures in connection with the launch of the customer portal.

CNIL conducted three inspections at BRICO PRIVÉ between 2018 and 2021 and identified several deficiencies in the processing of personal data of prospects and customers.
The controller, for example, had not complied with the data retention periods it had established. In this regard the data of more than 16,000 customers who had not placed an order in the last five years had been retained. The same applied to more than 130,000 people who had not logged into their customer accounts for five years.
In addition, the controller violated its information obligations under Art. 13 GDPR. Furthermore, the controller failed to fulfill its obligation to fully comply with the deletion requests received. 
The CNIL also found that the controller did not implement sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security. Thus, for example, the controller did not require the use of a secure password during the process of opening an account the company´s website or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software. The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 300,000 for violations of Art. 5(1) e) GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 17 GDPR and Art. 32 GDPR and EUR 200,000 for violations of Art. 82 Loi informatique et libertés and Art.

The subscriber to the magazine was required to accept the terms of the subscription and contract, which included consent to direct marketing. If the consent to direct marketing was not given, the magazine could not be subscribed. The DPA states that the consent and the way it was obtained did not comply with the GDPR. Indeed, the consent was not specifically requested for direct marketing and the consent collected together with the subscription and contract terms did not constitute voluntary consent for the purpose of direct marketing. 

In addition, it was not possible for data subjects to exercise their right to object due to the fact that the direct marketing calls were made using automated calling systems and the voice bots could not understand specific questions from data subjects about their data.

In particular, the former employee complained that the municipality processed personal data related to his internet use during working hours and that he later received a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings accusing him of accessing Facebook for more than 40 minutes and YouTube for more than 3 hours during his working hours and of using the municipality's computer for private purposes.  The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.

The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. 

Furthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form. The form provided by the controller had to be checked by the head of the organizational unit, a circumstance that led to the unlawful processing of health data."

At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.

For each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account.

In addition, the DPA found that aiComply failed to contractually regulate the relationships with two other companies that processed data on its behalf."

IRELAND,2021-09-02,"225,000,000","Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 14 GDPR, The Irish DPA (DPC) has imposed a fine of EUR 225,000,000 on WhatsApp Ireland Ltd. The DPA had started extensive investigations into the messaging service's compliance with transparency obligations back in December 2018. In this context, the DPC investigated whether WhatsApp complied with its obligations under the GDPR regarding the provision of information and the transparency of this information to users and non-users of WhatsApp. 

In the course of the investigation, the DPC found that WhatsApp had committed serious violations of Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR with respect to the information provided to users. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other affected European supervisory authorities in December 2020. The DPC subsequently received objections from eight supervisory authorities. Due to lack of agreement, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR on June 3, 2021. 

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. 

Based on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and
EUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.


With respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.

With regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. 

Given the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR."

The AEPD had received a complaint from the Berlin DPA via the EU Internal Market Information System about the inadequate design of the controller's privacy notice. 
Namely, the identity and contact details of the controller were provided in the privacy notice, but under a misleading heading that gave the impression that they were provided for a business purpose. In addition, the purposes of the processing were not clearly stated. 
No information was provided regarding the legal basis, the retention period of the personal data and the data subjects' right to object. Also, the privacy notice was confusing and the wording contained grammatical errors and used terms that are not part of common usage.

In addition, the privacy notice required a tax identification number in order to issue a simplified invoice, i.e., an invoice not exceeding the amount of EUR 3,000. The AEPD found this to be a violation of the principle of legality. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 3,000 for a breach of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR;
EUR 1,000 for a breach of Art. 21 (4) GDPR; and
EUR 2,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 GDPR."

DENMARK,2021-09-08,"53,800","Art. 32 GDPR, The Danish DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 53,800 on Midtjylland Region.

On June 12, 2020, the DPA received a notification from the region regarding a personal data security breach pursuant to Art. 33 GDPR. According to the notification, all patients and staff at a lifestyle center were able to access a building where up to 100,000 physical patient records were stored, including health information and personal identity number details. The reason for this was that both staff and patients had been given key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, regardless of whether the user was required to access them. 
In addition, passersby were able to take a look at the covers of some of the records -which showed personal data such as identity numbers and names - through a window in the building.
In this context, the DPA found that the Midtjylland Region had not taken adequate security measures for the storage of personal data.

In addition, the region had not established sufficient guidelines for access restrictions when creating key cards, and had not conducted adequate periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures taken. 

In evaluating the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data."

The computer hard drive in question was not encrypted and the program in question, which contained confidential and sensitive personal data, was not equipped with security measures.

In reviewing the case, the DPO found that Favrskov Municipality had not ensured the encryption of the hard drives of the municipality's laptops for a long period of time prior to August 12, 2020, resulting in an inadequate level of security.

In this context, the DPA found that the region had not implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk. 
In assessing whether a fine should be imposed, the DPA took into aggravating consideration the fact that Syddanmark Region processes large amounts of personal data, including health data - which is of a sensitive nature."

Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.

As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.

These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. 

After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. 

For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. 

In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect."

The draft primarily addresses the fact that Facebook has included details on data processing in its terms of service, thus relying on Art. 6 (1) b) rather than on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. 
Critics consider this a loophole used by Facebook to circumvent the stricter GDPR requirements of consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR.

However, the DPC emphasizes that the GDPR does not establish a hierarchy of legal bases that can be used to process personal data.

Yet, the DPC noted that Facebook failed to provide clear information about its legal basis for data processing and highlights that the information provided by Facebook is discontinuous and that users are referred to different documents and texts of the data policy and terms of service. 

The DPC concludes its draft that Facebook has thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 (1) GDPR and Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR.

The draft decision will now be forwarded to other European data protection authorities allowing them to comment on it."
ITALY,2021-09-16,"200,000","Art. 5 (1) a), c), e) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 9 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 25 GDPR, Art. 35 GDPR, Art. 44 GDPR, Art. 46 GDPR, Art. Art. 2-sexies Codice della Privacy, The Italian DPA (Garante) has imposed a fine of EUR 200,000 on Bocconi University. A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. 
Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR."

In May 2020, a trade union filed a complaint with the CNIL alleging that the number of strike days exercised by staff were included in files used to prepare promotion decisions. The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions.

The DPA's investigation revealed that the published data originated from an unsecured backup copy of a database. 

The DPA found that the data breach occurred due to the company's failure to comply with its obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. 

The company had, for example, failed to appoint a person with appropriate competence to be responsible for security and risk management.  It had also failed to ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated.

NORWAY,2021-12-13,"6,300,000","Art. 6 (1) GDPR, Art. 9 (1) GDPR, The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC EUR 6.3 million. Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. 

Under GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. 

Users had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. 


The DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. 

The DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent. 

---UPDATE---

The Norwegian Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the DPA to issue the fine."

FINLAND,2021-12-07,"608,000","Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR, Art. 33 (1) GDPR, Art. 34 (1) GDPR, The Finnish DPA has fined Vastaamo psychotherapy center EUR 608,000. In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.

The most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.

For this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.

As part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation. 

The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145, 600 for the breach of Art. 34 (1) GDPR and EUR 316, 800 for the breach of Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR."

The DPA had received several complaints against IAB Europe since 2019. In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. 

The OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. 

When users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. 

As part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. 

Within the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.

It found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.

In addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. 

Furthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment. 

Appendix: The Belgian Market Court annuled the imposed fine of EUR 250,000 but upheld the violations found and sanctions imposed."

Health data are sensitive data in the sense of Art. 9 GDPR. These may only be processed in exceptional cases pursuant to Art. 9 (2) GDPR.

One such exceptional case is processing on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health. For this, however, the processing must be based on a clear legal norm. In the cases at hand, the processing was based on a protocol that did not meet these requirements."

A former managing director had filed a complaint against the company with the DPA. In the context of being dismissed, the former managing director deleted all data on the work laptop before handing over the technical equipment. 
According to the managing director, only the private data, such as the private e-mail inbox, had been deleted. However, the company stated that the managing director had deleted both private and work-related data. The company then restored the data that had previously been on the laptop. 

For this reason, the former managing director requested to exercise their right to delete, restrict the processing of their personal data and object. 

However, the company refused the request. In the course of its investigation, the DPA found that the company had breached its obligation under the GDPR to grant the former managing director the exercise of these rights. 

In addition, the DPA found that due to the lack of a valid legal basis at the time of the restoration, the company unlawfully processed the data."

As part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. 

The Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.

The DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. 

Further, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. 

In addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. 

Furthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. 

The DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. 

The fine is composed as follows: 

EUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;

The leaked data included information on the surnames, first names, social security number, name of the treating physician, data on medical examinations and illnesses of the data subjects. 

During its investigation, the CNIL found several violations of the GDPR.

Namely, DEDALUS had violated Art. 29 GDPR by extracting more data than required in the course of processing on behalf of two laboratories. 

In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS had failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data. This constitutes a violation of Art. 32 GDPR.

For example, no specific procedure for data migration operations had been implemented. Also, the leaked data had not been stored in encrypted form on the server. In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS lacked authentication for access to the public area of the server. 

The absence of such security measures was one of the main causes of the data leak. 

Further, the DPA found that the contractual documents between DEDALUS and its customers did not comply with the requirements set forth in Art. 28 GDPR.

Of the 90 e-mail addresses affected, 75 e-mail addresses referred to patients and/or family members/caregivers of the patients, which meant that these individuals could be identified by name.

The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principle of 'integrity and confidentiality,' which requires that personal data be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage by appropriate technical and organizational measures.

FRANCE,2022-07-07,"175,000","Art. 5 (1) c), e) GDPR, Art. 12 GDPR, The French DPA (CNIL) has fined the company UBEEQO INTERNATIONAL EUR 175,000. 

The vehicle rental company had collected geolocation data on rented vehicles at every 500 meters. The company stated that they had collected the data to monitor the condition of the fleet, to locate the vehicle in case of theft, and to assist customers in case of an accident, among other reasons. However, the DPA found that none of these purposes justified the collection of geolocation data in such detail. For this reason, the DPA found a violation of the principle of data minimization pursuant to Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR. 

The DPA also found that the company had stored the vehicle data for an excessively long period of time. The data was kept for the duration of the business relationship with a customer and then for another three years after the termination of the vehicle rental. In addition, personal data of users who had been inactive for more than eight years were still stored in the company's databases.

The CNIL found that this long retention constituted a violation of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR. 

Finally, the DPA found that users were not adequately informed during the registration process on the company portal, and that the company thus violated Art. 12 GDPR."

The employee used the phone to access their work email account which contained information on the names of several citizens, social security numbers and health data. 



During its investigation, the DPA found that the phone was not protected by a password. Therefore, it was possible to access the information stored on the phone. 



The DPA concluded that this incident had occurred due to the municipality's failure to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. The municipality should have ensured, at least, that each employee secured their cell phone with a password."

Both CNIL and other European DPAS had received complaints against ACCOR from several individuals. 



In the course of its investigation, CNIL found that hotel guests who made a booking directly with the hotel or on one of the hotel group's websites automatically became recipients of an advertising newsletter as the box for consent to receive the newsletter was pre-ticked. In addition, the CNIL found that due to technical problems, many individuals were unable to opt-out of receiving the promotional emails. 



In this context, CNIL found that ACCOR had not sufficiently informed data subjects about the processing of their personal data in the context of promotional messages and thus violated Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR. 



Further, ACCOR had failed to respond to data subjects' requests for access to personal data in a timely manner, and thus the CNIL found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR. 



The company had also failed to comply with the data subjects' right to object due to the technical problems. The CNIL therefore found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 21 GDPR. 



Finally, the CNIL found a violation of Art. 32 GDPR because ACCOR allowed the use of passwords that were not sufficiently secure. 



In imposing the fine, CNIL considered aggravatingly that the violations affected several fundamental principles of personal data protection and constituted a fundamental infringement of the rights of the data subjects, as well as the number of data subjects involved."

The DPC subsequently received objections from six supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure at the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in Brussels. In its decision, the EDPB requested the DPC to increase the proposed fine.

The DPC's investigation revealed that on Instagram business accounts of minors, their cell phone numbers and email addresses were publicly displayed.

The DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 210 million for violations related to the provision of its Facebook service and EUR 180 million for violations related to the provision of its Instagram service. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of two individuals. 

Meta had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, Meta informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. Meta assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between Meta and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to Meta, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that Meta was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, Meta was actually forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that Meta did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that Meta relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that Meta had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. 

As no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by Meta. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that Meta was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that Meta had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required Meta to bring its data processing into compliance within three months."

In the course of its investigation, the DPA initially found that customers were supposed to give their consent to the privacy notices, the cookie policy, and the GTC at the same time. The DPA considered this to be a breach of Art. 6 GDPR and Art. 7 GDPR, as the data subject's consent to the processing of their personal data could not be considered voluntary due to the lack of separate options for consenting to the different notices. 



Douglas had merged with other companies and in the process acquired additional personal data. The DPA found that after acquiring the data, Douglas had kept the data for an excessive period of time without obtaining consent from the data subjects to use it for its own purposes. 



The DPA also found that Douglas retained data of customers who had not renewed their loyalty cards for an excessive period of time. 



Douglas also failed to provide its customers with sufficient and accurate information about the data processing. 



The DPA also found that Douglas did not use the data for direct marketing in accordance with customer consent. For example, customers who had only consented to telemarketing also received SMS marketing messages. 



Finally, the DPA found that Douglas had breached its accountability obligations regarding the processing of personal data on its blog."

The fine is the highest ever imposed by AZOP. AZOP had received an anonymous complaint in December 2022 stating that a large number of debtors' personal data had been processed by the collection agency without authorization. Attached to the complaint was a USB stick containing personal data (name, date of birth, personal identification number) of 77,317 debtors. 

During its investigation, AZOP found that controller did not provide sufficient information about the processing of personal data in its privacy policy. Moreover, it failed to provide information about the legal basis for the refund of overpaid funds. The breach affected 132,652 individuals. 

Further, the AZOP found that the controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of 83,896 individuals at risk. The breach persisted for 2 years.

Finally, AZOP found that the controller had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. 
Deficiencies in the controller's security system led to insecure processing of personal data on a large scale, resulting in the unauthorized filtering of data. AZOP noted that the breach has been ongoing since at least 2019 and has not been addressed to date. 

Aggravating factors considered by AZOP included the controller's failure to adequately cooperate with the DPA during the process. Furthermore, the controller has not yet informed AZOP of additional measures it has taken to prevent future risks of identified violations and has not yet brought its privacy policy into compliance with the GDPR."

IRELAND,2023-05-12,"1,200,000,000","Art. 46 (1) GDPR, The Irish DPA (DPC) has fined Meta Platforms Ireland Limited EUR 1.2 billion. This is the highest fine imposed to date under the GDPR. In its decision, the DPC found that Meta had violated Art. 46 GDPR by continuing to transfer personal data to the U.S. after the Schrems II ruling of the CJEU. According to the Schrems II ruling, U.S. law does not provide a level of protection for personal data substantially equivalent to that provided by EU law and that the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) also do not provide sufficient protection. Meta based its data transfers on the SCCs and additional own safeguards. However, during its investigation, the DPC determined that these additional measures did not compensate for the inadequate protections provided by U.S. law. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision to other concerned supervisory authorities pursuant to Art. 60 GDPR. In response, the DPC received objections from supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure before the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). In its decision, the EDPB asked the DPC to amend the proposed fine and adapt it to the seriousness of the data protection breach.

The DPC also ordered to cease any future transfer of personal data to the U.S., as well as to cease storage, within six months, of data already transferred to the U.S.

Meta has announced that it will appeal the ruling and seek a suspension of the orders in court."

AZOP had received a complaint from a data subject, stating that the controller had obtained a copy of their bank card. 



During its investigation, AZOP found that the controller had collected personal data (including copies of bank cards) of data subjects without a valid legal basis. In 2022, players had the option to have their winnings paid out not only via their bank account but also via their Visa card. The controller collected copies of the bank cards with the intention of complying with requirements of the national Money Laundering Act. However, AZOP found that the collection of the copies was not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Act and that the processing of the data was therefore unlawful.



In this context, AZOP also found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, in particular, it was expressly stated that the data controller does not store bank card numbers and that the numbers are not accessible to the unauthorized persons. Accordingly, the information provided to the data subjects was missing information on the legal basis, purpose of collection and retention period of the personal data. 



The controller also failed to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data relating to the establishment of payment processes via Visa bank cards, as well as for the storage of data contained in the controller's databases. 



As a result, in 2022 the controller collected copies of a total of 2078 bank cards, of which 655 copies were fully accessible. 



In assessing the fine amount, AZOP took into account as an aggravating factor that financial data is particularly sensitive data and the controller therefore should have taken special measures to protect it. 



As a mitigating circumstance, it was taken into account that the controller had announced that it would bring its processing procedures in line with the GDPR and had deleted all secured copies of the bank cards."

The company was running an international project to improve patient care by collecting and analyzing health data. 

To participate in the project, GPs were required to add an additional function to their existing management software.  The additional function was supposed to automatically anonymize patient data and transfer it to the company's database. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the add-on feature installed did not effectively anonymize data. 
In addition, the DPA found that Thin had also violated its information obligations under the GDPR. The company had incorrectly assumed that it was processing anonymized data and had actually processed personal data without providing adequate information to the data subjects."

In addition, it was not stated that activities were carried out through Facebook-Meta, in which customers' email addresses were forwarded to the American company.

As for the e-commerce activities on the website, it was found that, although broad profiling was carried out, Rinascente had not carried out a data protection impact assessment in accordance with the GDPR.

A consumer organization reported problems with the service, which provides toll refunds for delays caused by roadworks, to the DPA.
The DPA found that Autostrade held the position of  the data controller, instead of a processor, as stated in the documents governing the relationship between 'ASPI' and 'Free to X', the company that develops and operates the app, as well as in the information notice given to users.
In fact, 'ASPI', as the operator of the highway network, was responsible for determining the reimbursement mechanism, the type of compensation measures, the processing and the causes of delays due to road works. 'Free to X' was only tasked with implementing the service. This incorrect assignment of privacy roles resulted in the notice to users being incorrect. The notice should have included the actual identity of the controller, namely ASPI, as well as all the necessary information for proper and transparent processing in accordance with data protection laws.

As a result, the DPC concluded that TikTok had failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that only necessary personal data was being processed.
Furthermore, the DPC noted that the 'Family Pairing' feature, which allowed non-child users to link their accounts with those of child users, posed a security risk to the personal data of children.
Additionally, TikTok failed to provide child users with information about the categories of recipients of their personal data and clear, understandable information on the scope and implications of data processing.
The DPC also found that TikTok introduced so-called 'dark patterns,' leading users to frequently opt for less privacy-friendly options during registration and when posting videos on the platform. In addition to the fine, the DPC issued an order requiring TikTok to bring its processing activities in line with the GDPR within three months."

The DPA had received a complaint from a citizen concerning Zagreb Holding's practice of requesting a copy of users' personal identification cards before issuing invoices via email. Previously, to receive invoice by email the users only needed to provide their name, surname, address, personal identification number, facility number and their user number. 

 

During the investigation, it was found that Zagreb Holding lacked established rules for identifying service users requesting invoice copies via email and only collected copies of identification documents when there was suspicion of false representation. The company requested personal identification document copies from users whose email addresses had a different name/ structure than their name and surname, or if the user's name and surname in the email address did not match the requested invoice copy email address's structure. The DPA found that the mere inclusion of the correct name and surname in an email address is an insufficient protective measure. Consequently, the data controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures for user identification, contrary to Art. 25 (2) GDPR. According to the explanation given by the DPA, the data controller should have developed a process for identification via email ensuring a uniform procedure for all users, regardless of the email address structure.

Furthermore, the data controller failed to transparently inform service users about the legal basis for collecting personal data (scan of personal identification card) for identification purposes. Such information were not available on the company's official website nor provided upon direct request via email."
CROATIA,2023-09-26,"15,000","Art. 6 (1) GDPR,  Art. 13 (1), (2) GDPR, Art. 32 (1) a), d) GDPR, Art. 32 (4) GDPR, Art. 38 (6) GDPR, The Croatian DPA (AZOP) has imposed of fine of EUR 15,000 to a hotel. The hotel was collecting personal data from guests in excess of what would have been necessary for the purpose of booking a hotel room and without a valid legal basis. Specifically, the hotel collected the CVC number of guests' credit cards and copies of their identification documents. The hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data.

 

The hotel claimed it collected the CVC numbers of credit cards and even copies of personal identification document, when the booking was made via email, in order to prevent misuse of the credit cards. The booking was possible via third party platforms and the hotel’s email and web form. The booking via email and web form enables solely booking, but not payment. Regardless of this, the hotel still requested provision of financial data (information on the credit card and CVC number). Taking into consideration that the booking was possible without provision of the CVC number, AZOP found that hotel did not have a legal basis for processing of such data.

 

The hotel also failed to provide clear and transparent information to guests on the collection and use of their data. Neither the hotel's general terms and conditions nor the form of consent for use of personal data provided sufficient information on circumstances of processing. In addition, the hotel did not undertake adequate technical and organisational measures, e.g. encryption of data. 

 

Finally, by appointing the hotel manager as the data protection officer, the controller violated the provisions of Art. 38 (6) GDPR. Although the data protection officer may also perform other tasks and duties, the controller must ensure that such tasks and duties do not lead to a conflict of interest. Accordingly, the controller should have been aware that there is a conflict of interest in relation to the tasks and duties that the hotel manager performs. It is clear from the job description of the hotel manager that they are largely responsible for making management decisions concerning personal data processing, while on the other hand, as the data protection officer, they are obliged to monitor the compliance of the business with the regulations governing the protection of personal data."

During its investigation, the DPA found that the controller had failed to adequately comply with its information obligations under Art. 13 GDPR. For example, there was a lack of detailed information on the purposes of processing personal data on the website. Furthermore, the design of a cookie banner used so-called dark patterns, with the pop-up giving users only the choice between consent and access to the settings page. This meant that it was not possible for users to simply refuse the use of cookies, but that they could only do so via the settings menu and many clicks. The fine is made up of EUR 5,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, EUR 5,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR and EUR 2,000 for the violation of the national law Art. 22 LSSI."

FRANCE,2024-01-23,"15,000,000","Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR, Art. 6 GDPR, Art. 12 GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 32 GDPR, The French DPA (CNIL) has imposed a fine of EUR 32 million on AMAZON FRANCE LOGISTIQUE for unlawful surveillance of employees. 

CNIL found that Amazon France equips its warehouse employees with a scanner to document certain tasks.


Each scan records data that is stored and can be used to calculate a series of indicators that provide information on the productivity of each employee.

The CNIL considered the establishment of a system that measures interruptions in activity with precision and potentially forces the employee to justify each break or interruption to be unlawful.


The CNIL also noted that the data collected by the system and the statistical indicators derived from it should be stored for 31 days. 

While the CNIL did not doubt that Amazon's intensive business needs and high performance objectives could justify the implementation of the scanner system for business management, it considered that the extensive storage of all these data was unlawful. Overall, however, it considered the extensive storage of all these data and statistical indicators to be disproportionate.

The CNIL also found a breach of the information and transparency obligation under the GDPR, as employees and external visitors were not adequately informed about the systems. Finally, the CNIL found that the video surveillance software was not sufficiently secured.

---Update---

The French Council of State reduced the fine from EUR 32,000,000 to EUR 15,000,000 because the DPO incorrectly assessed the appropriate amount of the fine. The DPO also has to publish the decision on its website."

CROATIA,2024-04-22,,"Art. 27 Croatin Law on the Implementation of the GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, The Croatian DPA (AZOP) has imposed seven fines totaling EUR 16,000 on data controllers for failing to adequately mark video-monitored areas. This lack of marking resulted in people entering these areas not being informed of the surveillance, as the signs were either not visible on entry or did not contain all the necessary information. The fines ranged from EUR 500 to 4,000 and were imposed on various establishments, including hotels, restaurants, and shops.

According to Art. 27 (1) of the Law on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is the responsibility of data controllers to ensure that areas under video surveillance are clearly marked. These signs must be visible to individuals at the latest when entering the surveillance perimeter. Furthermore, according to Paragraph 2 of the same article, the signs must contain all relevant information as stipulated in Art. 13 GDPR. This especially includes informing individuals that the area is under video surveillance, providing details about the data controller, and offering contact information through which individuals can exercise their data protection rights."

The data controller collected and processed personal data of data subjects through cookies without providing them the opportunity to give or withdraw consent for such processing in an informed and voluntary manner, violating Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 7 GDPR. In cases where personal data processing relies on consent and serves multiple purposes, the consent mechanism, such as the cookie banner, must be clearly distinguishable, easily accessible, and use language that is clear and simple to understand. However, in this specific case, the data controller failed to separate the cookie banner, preventing data subjects from giving clear consent for different purposes like marketing or analytics. Furthermore, an examination of the privacy policy of the data controller revealed deficiencies. This document lacked information regarding the legal basis for data processing, types of cookies used, the purpose of each cookie, and the duration of cookie storage. Consequently, data subjects were not adequately informed about the processing of their personal data, breaching Art. 13 (1) and (2) GDPR. This failure to inform data subjects about cookie processing violated the transparency principle, depriving website visitors of crucial information about how their data was handled."

Moreover, the DPA found that the controller processed personal data of data subjects as soon as they accessed the webpage, even before they consented to certain cookies. This practice was considered unfair since the data subjects were unaware that their personal data was being collected at the time of website access. Such unfair processing violates the principle of lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data outlined in Art. 5 (1) GDPR.

During its investigation, the DPA found that the company had not adequately processed deletion requests from data subjects as they had not provided specific reasons for their deletion request. It was also revealed that the company was unlawfully using 'shadow blocking' to remove users from the platform without their knowledge, which violated the principles of fairness and transparency. This also impaired users' ability to exercise their rights under the GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the company had not taken sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with the principle of accountability and to be able to demonstrate that it had taken appropriate measures regarding the right of access.

Additionally, the company did not respond to two access requests from data subjects. The company also failed to facilitate the right of access of data subjects located within the territory of the Netherlands. Lastly, the company had not appointed a representative within the European Union as required under the GDPR."

In July 2024, the DPC issued a draft decision under the GDPR cooperation mechanism under Art. 60 GDPR, to which no objections were raised.
During its investigation, the DPC found that LinkedIn had no valid legal basis for processing user data for the purposes of behavioral analysis and targeted advertising.
The DPC found that LinkedIn could not rely on Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR, as the consent of the users did not appear to be freely given, informed and unambiguous. Furthermore, according to the DPC, LinkedIn could not rely on Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, as the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the users outweighed the interests of LinkedIn. The DPC also ruled that LinkedIn could not rely on Article 6 (1) b) GDPR as a legal basis.
Finally, the DPC also found that LinkedIn had not provided users with sufficient information about the data processing in accordance with Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR and Art. 14 (1) c) GDPR."

Compromised data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and children's data. The breach resulted from the exploitation of user tokens on the platform by unauthorized third parties. The DPC found that Meta had violated Art. 33 GDPR (EUR 11 million), as information was missing from the data breach notification, for example. The DPC also found violations of Art. 25 GDPR (EUR 240 million), concluding that Meta had failed to ensure that data protection principles were protected in the design of processing systems and had failed in its obligations as a controller to ensure that, by default, only personal data that are necessary for specific purposes are processed."

The investigation revealed that the hospital failed to implement appropriate technical measures to safeguard personal data, as no backups of the affected data were made (violation of Art. 32 (1) b) GDPR). Moreover, the hospital did not report the incident within the required 72 hours after becoming aware of it (violation of Art. 33 (1) GDPR).

Further violations included the unclear definition of retention periods for personal data from recorded telephone conversations (violation of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR) and the unlawful recording of conversations lacking a legal basis (violation of Art. 6 (1) GDPR). 

Additionally, the clinic did not inform patients in clear and plain language about the processing of their personal data when they called the call center, nor did it provide all the necessary information about the collection of personal data through the recording of these conversations (violation of Art. 12 (1) GDPR, Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR and Art. 13 (2) a), b) GDPR.

It was found that when the electricity and gas supplies were activated, consents of data subjects were recorded incorrectly. E.ON failed to take appropriate measures to verify the accuracy of the consent given by customers and the corresponding data stored in the systems, which resulted in telemarketing being carried out without a lawful basis.
Furthermore, the DPA found that there was a lack of sufficient control and training of the employees responsible for these activities.

Lastly the AEPD ordered ORANGE BANK to bring their processes into compliance with the GDPR within 6 months after the decision becomes final and enforceable."

The company was responsible for monitoring parking lots at several supermarkets and a hospital. However, it accessed personal data – in particular license plate numbers and owner information – from the Croatian Ministry of the Interior's (MUP) vehicle registry without a valid legal basis. Access was gained via a web service that the company had secured the right to use in certain areas on the basis of a concession. However, the actual use went beyond the scope of this concession. In addition, a data processing agreement with the hospital was missing, the system was operated without appropriate technical and organizational protective measures, and there was no legal basis for processing the data.

Furthermore, the company did not inform the data subjects about the processing of their data and did not properly document its processing activities. Another point of concern was that the data protection officer was also the managing director of the company, which constitutes a conflict of interest under the GDPR. Therefore, the company was fined for breaching Art. 5 (1) (a) and (e), Art. 6 (1) (f), Art. 12, Art. 14, Art. 30, and Art. 38 (3) and (6) GDPR."

Following a cyberattack, it was revealed that over a period of seven days, at least 3 GB of personal data had been unlawfully copied from the system.

The controller transferred customer personal data to a processor in the Republic of Serbia (a group company maintaining software). Transfers had been based on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) from 16 April 2020 until at the latest 27 December 2022; after that date, transfers continued without SCCs or equivalent safeguards, despite Serbia lacking an adequacy decision. The Serbian processor had administrator access to the controller’s SAP CRM database covering 847,862 data subjects, with access to extensive customer data (including name, Personal Identification Number, address, service/installation/billing addresses, contact details, email, IBAN for SEPA direct debit users, MSISDN, ICCID, and service information). The controller also failed to conduct a transfer risk assessment before commencing transfers. In addition, the controller did not transparently inform data subjects about third-country transfers, using vague “may” language in privacy policies instead of clearly stating that data are transferred outside the EEA, thereby breaching transparency obligations. Separately, the controller excessively processed employee data by collecting copies of employees’ ID cards and certificates of no criminal proceedings without a valid legal basis and contrary to the data minimisation and purpose limitation principles; notably, it disregarded its DPO’s opinion flagging such collection as excessive. Finally, the controller failed to carry out prior checks of a telesales processor’s security measures and engaged a processor lacking even basic safeguards, in breach of Article 28(1) GDPR."
